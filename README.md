## Description üìù
The **Jetpack** is a project carried out by **groups of 3** (see [Contributors](https://github.com/toro-nicolas/Jetpack/blob/main/README.md#contributors-), during our **2nd year** in [**EPITECH**](https://www.epitech.eu/) Grand Ecole program.  
Its purpose is to recreate in [**C++**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) a [**Jetpack Joyride game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpack_Joyride) with a **multiplayer** mode.  
We had to create a **server** and a **client** that communicate with each other using the **TCP protocol**.  
The game is a **side-scrolling** runner where the player controls a character that automatically moves forward.  
The player can control the character's vertical position by pressing space key to make it fly and releasing it to let it fall.  
The goal is to collect coins while avoiding obstacles.  


## Usage ‚öîÔ∏è
You can run Jetpack server like this :
```sh
./jetpack_server -p [port] -m [map]
```
For more information, please see the help section.
```sh
> ./jetpack_server --help
USAGE: ./jetpack_server -p <port> -m <map> [-d]

DESCRIPTION:
        -p <port>       The port number on which the server socket listens
        -m <map>        The path of the map file
        -d              Enable debug mode
        -in             Enable infinite mode
        --help          Display this help message

```

You can run Jetpack client like this :
```sh
./jetpack_client -h [host] -p [port]
```
For more information, please see the help section.
```sh
> ./jetpack_client --help
USAGE: ./jetpack_client -h <ip> -p <port> [-d]

DESCRIPTION:
        -h <ip> The server IP address
        -p <port>       The port number on which the server socket listens
        -d              Enable debug mode
        --help          Display this help message

## Code mandatory üì¶
- You'll need to create a branch where you'll push your code. Once you've completed your tasks on this branch, we'll work together to merge it and check that everything works.
- Every function you add must be code-style and documented.
- If the github actions don't succeed, then ask yourself some questions
- Each commit will contain ```[+]``` or ```[-]``` or ```[~]``` followed by a message
    - ```[+]``` : Add feature
    - ```[-]``` : Delete feature
    - ```[~]``` : Edit feature

**Of course, in exceptional cases, we may depart from these rules.**
